<h1><strong>Affiliate Disclosure</strong></h1>
<p><em>Last Updated: August 5, 2025</em></p>

<p>At <strong>Magic Box Gifts</strong>, we believe in honesty, transparency, and helping you find the perfect gifts with confidence. This page explains how we use affiliate links and how we support our free content.</p>

<h2>What Are Affiliate Links?</h2>

<p>We are a participant in the <strong>Amazon Services LLC Associates Program</strong>, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for websites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com.</p>

<p>This means that when you click on certain links on our site and make a purchase through Amazon, we may earn a small commission â€” <strong>at no extra cost to you</strong>.</p>

<h2>ðŸ’¡ How It Works</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We only recommend products we genuinely believe will be useful, high-quality, or thoughtful gifts for your situation.</li>
  <li>If you buy through our affiliate links, we receive a small percentage of the sale.</li>
  <li><strong>You pay the same price</strong> â€” your purchase cost is unaffected.</li>
  <li>These earnings help us maintain and improve this website, allowing us to continue offering free gift guides, product reviews, and curated gift boxes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Important Notes</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>No extra cost to you</strong>: We do not charge you more for using our links.</li>
  <li><strong>Not a sponsored post</strong>: Our recommendations are based on best match for your gifting needs.</li>
  <li><strong>We donâ€™t endorse every product</strong>: We only link to items we believe are helpful, high-quality, or thoughtful.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What About Other Affiliate Programs?</h2>

<p>In addition to Amazon, we may also be part of other affiliate programs (e.g., Walmart, Etsy, or brand-specific programs). These are disclosed on individual product pages or within relevant content.</p>

<h2>Why We Use Affiliate Links</h2>

<p>The income from affiliate programs helps us:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cover website hosting and maintenance</li>
  <li>Research and test new gift ideas</li>
  <li>Create helpful guides, gift lists, and seasonal recommendations</li>
  <li>Keep our site 100% free for you to use</li>
</ul>

<p>We are committed to providing honest, thoughtful, and valuable content â€” even if we earn a commission.</p>
